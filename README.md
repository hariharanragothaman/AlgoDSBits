Solutions to leetcode online challenges, topic wise.

### Ways to Revise      
1. Check-in / Revise everyday based on Topics and frequency in topics
2. Revise problems everyday           

### Strategy:   
1. We need to split our time between solving new problems & revising old ones.   
2. Goal: Solve 10 new Problems everyday.    
         Revise 10+ already solved problems.      
3. We need map 1-Topic per day and keep going     
4. During contests - we need to attack the entire Q-bank for that contest in Explore section.      
5. Learning is as important as revising. ---> Lead to solving more problems.
